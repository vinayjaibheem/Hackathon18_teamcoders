# Predicting Board Games Reviews

## Introduction
Its a simple Machine Learning project using Linear Regression to find the "average_rating" for a given board game.

## Data Set
1. Rows: 83000
2. Columns: 20 (features)
3. After analysing given 20 features, I choosed 2 features "average_weight" and "minage" because of their good correlation values.

## Programminig Language
Python is used here with libraries: 
1. pandas: for reading/writing csv files, dealing with dataframe object
2. sklearn: for LinearRegression, cross validation, mean square error and correlations
3. matplotlib: for plotting graphs

## How To Use?
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the following command:
```python script.py```
